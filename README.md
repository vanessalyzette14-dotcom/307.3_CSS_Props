# CSS Notes

### Display Type

Position Types:
- Outer Display Types - how elements surround that container are displayed (block, inline)
- Inner Display Types - say how the children / contents inside that container are displayed (flex, grid)

- Static - all elements by default
- Relative - starts from a static position, but gives access to top, right, bottom, left (preserves) the space if moved 
- Fixed - removes element from normal flow of code and FIXES it in place on the viewport, has access to the TOP, Right, Bottom and Left properties
