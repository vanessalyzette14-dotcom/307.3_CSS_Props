-   Relative - starts from a static position, but gives access to top, right, bottom, left (preserves the space if moved) 
-   Fixed - removes element from normal flow of code and FIXES it in place on the viewport, has access to the TOP, Right, Bottom and Left properties 
-   Absolute - removes elements from normal flow of code and allows access to Top, Right, Bottom and, LEft properties
